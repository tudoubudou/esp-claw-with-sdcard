# Claw Skill Component Spec

This document defines the standard `skills/` directory format, `SKILL.md` rules, metadata conventions, build sync rules, and filesystem path conventions for component-provided skills.

## Directory Layout

Any build component may provide a `skills/` directory:

```text
component_xx/
└── skills/
    └── skill_id/
        ├── SKILL.md
        ├── references/
        │   └── guide.md
        ├── scripts/
        │   └── action.lua
        └── assets/
            └── icon.jpg
```

Notes:

- `skills/<skill_id>/` is one complete skill.
- `SKILL.md` is the only required file.
- `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`, and other subdirectories are optional.
- The whole skill directory is packaged as one skill and copied unchanged into `skills/<skill_id>/` in the application SYSTEM file image.

## SKILL.md Rules

`SKILL.md` must start with JSON frontmatter:

```md
---
{
  "name": "skill_id",
  "description": "Short capability description.",
  "author": "bob",
  "metadata": {
    "category": ["game", "ui"],
    "tags": ["flappybird", "arcade", "demo", "button", "touch"],
    "peripherals": ["display"],
    "cap_groups": ["cap_lua"],
    "manage_mode": "web"
  },
  "execution": {
    "entry": "scripts/flappybird.lua",
    "icon": "assets/icon.jpg",
    "args": {},
    "order": 10,
    "visible": true
  }
}
---

# Skill Title
```

Rules:

- The frontmatter must be wrapped by `---`.
- The frontmatter must be valid JSON (a single JSON object).
- `SKILL.md` must contain exactly one H1 heading.
- `name` must be a non-empty string.
- `name` must exactly match the parent directory name `skills/<skill_id>`.
- `description` should briefly describe when to use the skill.
- `author` is optional, but if present it must be a non-empty string.
- If `author` contains angle brackets, it must use the form `Name <email>` with exactly one valid email address.
- `metadata` must be an object.
- `metadata.cap_groups` is optional. When present, it must be a JSON array of non-empty unique strings and declares the capability groups that need to be activated.
- `metadata.manage_mode` must be `readonly`, `web`, or `runtime`. Use `web` for ESP-Claw Skills Lab packaged skills. On device, `web` is treated the same as `readonly` for management (for example unregister rules). `runtime` is reserved for skills registered by the runtime.
- `metadata.category` must contain at least one value, and every value must be in the category allowlist.
- `metadata.peripherals` may contain zero or more values, and every value must be in the peripheral allowlist.
- `metadata.tags` is optional.
- `metadata.tags`, when present, must be a string array.
- `metadata.tags` is free-form and is not validated against an allowlist.
- `metadata.tags` must not repeat any value already present in `metadata.category` or `metadata.peripherals`.
- `execution` is optional. When present, it declares a System UI launcher entry for the skill.
- `execution.entry` is required when `execution` is present. It must be a skill-owned relative `.lua` path such as `scripts/action.lua`.
- `execution.icon` is optional. It must be a skill-owned relative `.jpg` or `.jpeg` launcher icon path when present. System UI decodes it to its fixed launcher icon size at runtime.
- `execution.args` is optional. It must be a JSON object and is passed to the launcher script as compact JSON.
- `execution.order` is optional. Lower values appear earlier in the launcher.
- `execution.visible` is optional and defaults to `true`; set it to `false` to keep the execution metadata without showing it in the launcher.
- `execution` does not support a `title` field. The launcher uses the skill id as the item title.
- Additional keys at the root of the frontmatter or inside `metadata` may appear (for example tooling or Skills Lab fields). The device runtime ignores keys it does not read.

### Description

`description` affects skill matching, so it must describe user intent rather than implementation details.

Rules:

- Include common user wording when applicable, such as turn on/off, set color, brightness, LED strip/light.
- Include critical prerequisites when they affect whether the skill can be used.
- Keep it concise and avoid long paragraphs.
- Do not describe only internal script names, module names, or generic execution phrases.

Example:

```json
"description": "Turn the board LED strip/light on or off, set color or brightness. Requires board_hardware_info skill."
```

## Build Sync Rules

During build, `sync_component_skills.py` scans the `skills/` directory of every build component.

Sync rules:

- Every `skills/<skill_id>/SKILL.md` must exist.
- Every skill id must be unique across the whole project.
- Every file in the skill directory belongs to that skill.
- Every file in the skill directory is copied into `skills/<skill_id>/` in the SYSTEM FATFS image.
- `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`, and other subdirectories keep their relative paths.
- The build fails if two components provide the same `skills/<skill_id>/...` output path.
- Old component skill files recorded in the build manifest are removed from the output directory when they no longer exist.

Source example:

```text
component_xx/skills/light_switch/SKILL.md
component_xx/skills/light_switch/scripts/switch.lua
```

Copied output:

```text
skills/light_switch/SKILL.md
skills/light_switch/scripts/switch.lua
```

The `skills/...` paths above are relative paths inside the device SYSTEM filesystem image, not source-tree paths.

## `{CUR_SKILL_DIR}` Placeholder

When `SKILL.md` is loaded, the skill runtime replaces `{CUR_SKILL_DIR}` in the document body with the current skill filesystem directory.

Example:

```md
Run `{CUR_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/action.lua` with `lua_run_script`.
```

Rules:

- `{CUR_SKILL_DIR}` is expanded only in the `SKILL.md` body, not in JSON frontmatter.
- The expanded value points to the current skill directory in the device filesystem. Built-in skills usually expand under `/system/skills/<skill_id>`, while runtime-installed user skills expand under the DATA root's `skills/<skill_id>`.
- Use `{CUR_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/...` when passing a script path from this skill to a tool.

## Filesystem Path Rules

File tool paths (`read_file`, `write_file`, ...) must be absolute. When the model
reads files bundled with a skill, use the `{CUR_SKILL_DIR}` placeholder, which
expands to the skill's absolute directory:

- `read_file("{CUR_SKILL_DIR}/references/guide.md")`
- `read_file("{CUR_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/action.lua")`
- `read_file("{CUR_SKILL_DIR}/assets/name.ext")`

Do not pass relative paths, do not assume the source component directory name, and do not use `../` to move to a parent directory.

Path roots:

- Built-in/component skills are staged into the read-only SYSTEM root (`/system/skills/...`).
- Runtime-installed/user skills are stored under the writable DATA root (`<DATA>/skills/...`). DATA is `/fatfs` for flash storage, or the board-manager SD card mount point when SD storage is active.
- Skill documents should use `{CUR_SKILL_DIR}` for bundled references, scripts, and assets. Do not hard-code `/fatfs/skills/...` for skill-local files.
- Writable files created by Lua scripts should use `storage.get_root_dir()` and `storage.join_path(...)` instead of assuming `/fatfs`.

## Lua Skill Script Rules

If a skill contains Lua scripts, place them under `scripts/`:

```text
skills/<skill_id>/scripts/action.lua
```

Rules:

- Skill-local Lua scripts are read-only files distributed with the skill.
- User-facing actions should be implemented as standalone skills rather than `test/` entries.
- If script execution fails, the skill should require the model to report the error directly and avoid retrying with changed arguments.

## Naming And Conflict Rules

- Skill ids must be stable. Prefer lowercase letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens.
- Skill ids must exactly match their directory names.
- The project must not contain duplicate skill ids.
- The project must not contain duplicate skill output file paths.
- Do not expose the same user-facing action through multiple skills or script indexes.
